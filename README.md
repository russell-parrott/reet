# REET - the Structural Governance Standard for AI

Refusal, escalation, exit and traceability (REET) is the Structural Governance Standard for AI.  It is defined through fifteen structural tests (Q1–Q15), each with specific questions, pass/fail criteria and evidence formats. Together, these tests provide a binary outcome: either the safeguards hold, or accountability fails.

The standard establishes AI governance as a discipline in its own right. Compliance is not treated as a statement of policy or intent but as a structural condition engineered into the system and independently verifiable in operation.

REET integrates:

- A universal taxonomy of structural breaches,
- Operational countermeasures to prevent recurrence,
- Methods of verification that withstand independent audit, and
- Safeguards designed to adapt under changing conditions.

Through these elements, REET sets the enforceable conditions under which trust in AI systems can be established, preserved, and demonstrably proven.

**What REET is**

REET is a public standard of enforceable tests. It is designed to close the gap between what systems claim and what they actually do. It is free to use, copy and enforce and will always remain open.

**What REET is not**

REET is not a maturity model, a grey score or a survey of opinions. If the safeguard holds, the system passes. If it does not, it fails. There is no in-between.

## Why this matters

The purpose of REET is not to measure sentiment. It is to create evidence that regulators, buyers, and individuals can rely on.

- **Regulators** can cite REET failures directly in enforcement orders.
- **Buyers** can make contracts contingent on REET passes instead of marketing claims.
- **Boards** can demand REET evidence before systems are deployed.
- **Individuals** can expose breaches with artefacts that stand up in disputes.
- **Auditors** can validate claims using a common structural standard rather than vendor-supplied metrics.
- **Insurers** can condition coverage and liability on the presence or absence of REET compliance.

In every case, REET replaces promises with proof.

REET establishes the standard; the tests GEM-60, REM-60 and VEM-60, expose its reality. They exist to prove whether the conditions defined by REET hold when observed, when stressed and when verified. Together they turn compliance from language into evidence.

### GEM-60 — The Governance Exposure Method

A one-hour live exposure drill that reveals whether a system can be governed in practice. GEM-60 tests the same four structural conditions, refusal, escalation, exit and traceability, but under inspection rather than stress. It exposes whether lawful control exists when observed directly.

### REM-60 — Resilience Exposure Method

A sixty-minute live stress test that measures whether governance holds under pressure. REM-60 takes the four REET conditions and applies operational strain to them, converting calm inspection into live stress. Where GEM-60 proves governability, REM-60 proves endurance.

### VEM-60 — The Verification Exposure Method

A one-hour live meta-verification layer that tests verifiability itself. VEM-60 checks whether a system can contain uncertainty, cite valid sources, preserve continuity, disclose limits and survive contradiction. It determines not what a system claims, but whether its truth can be verified independently.
