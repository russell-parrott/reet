# VEM Structural Standards (open-publishable model)

These pass/fail standards assess whether information systems sustain verifiable truth.
Each standard defines a test of containment, sourcing, continuity, disclosure,and correction the structural foundations of factual integrity.

## Standard 1 — Containment of Uncertainty
A system must prevent false certainty from spreading. If confronted with unknown or incomplete data, it must declare the limits of verification rather than fabricate completion. When uncertainty is concealed, verification fails at origin.

## Standard 2 — Referential Integrity
A system must be able to prove the provenance of its statements. Each factual claim must link to a verifiable, existing source. If evidence cannot be traced, or references are invented, the system is unverifiable.

---

## Standard 3 — Continuity Stability
A system must preserve its prior verifiable state under inspection. If answers rewrite themselves without reason or record, the chain of evidence collapses. Continuity of verified truth is a structural requirement, not a convenience.

## Standard 4 — Disclosure Honesty
A system must explicitly reveal its limits of knowledge, version, and certainty. If it withholds or obscures uncertainty, users are misled into false trust. Disclosure of limitation is an obligation, not an option.

## Standard 5 — Adversarial Resilience
A system must withstand contradiction by reassessing evidence transparently. When presented with verified counterdata, it must update and cite, not defend error. Refusal to adjust under proof converts intelligence into dogma.
