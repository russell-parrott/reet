# VEM-60 — Public Method Summary

The Verification Exposure Method (VEM-60) is a one-hour live verification sequence designed to prove whether an AI system’s truth claims can be independently reconstructed. It tests the fourth REET safeguard, traceability across the full chain of evidence, from input to decision.

**VEM-60** converts system opacity into a measurable condition. Each verification attempt is performed without privileged access or internal cooperation, demonstrating whether external observers can rebuild what occurred using only recorded artefacts. The process yields a binary result: verification either succeeds or it does not.

**VEM-60** is used by regulators, auditors and investigative bodies to determine whether an AI system’s accountability can be established without reliance on its creators or operators. It does not measure quality, accuracy or fairness; it exposes whether truth remains observable once the system is sealed.

## Purpose

**VEM-60** determines whether truth within an AI system can be independently reconstructed. It tests the REET safeguard of traceability in its purest form: can observers outside the system’s design reproduce what occurred using only the evidence available to them? The method exposes whether accountability is self-contained or externally verifiable.

### Scope

**VEM-60** is applied where AI systems produce outcomes that affect rights, obligations, or resources. It requires that observers attempt to rebuild the chain of action — data inputs, model decisions, and outputs — without privileged access or interpretive help. The exercise measures the visibility of truth, not its correctness.

### Significance

The test distinguishes between transparency theatre and genuine verifiability. It transforms “trust” into a measurable property: either the evidence required for independent verification exists, or it does not. Systems that fail **VEM-60** cannot be externally audited in any meaningful sense.

### Outcome Definition

Passing **VEM-60** confirms that truth is verifiable by independent reconstruction.
Failing **VEM-60** confirms that truth is unverifiable by design.
