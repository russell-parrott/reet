# Structural Governance Standard for AI — Policy Overview

## Purpose
Structural Governance Standard for AI is a structural safeguard for AI systems, ensuring that individuals and organisations can halt or redirect AI-driven decisions before they cause harm or become binding, without penalty or loss of access.

## Policy Relevance
Structural Governance Standard for AI directly supports policy objectives in:
- **Education** — Safeguarding students, educators, and institutions from automated decisions that may be inaccurate, biased, or harmful.
- **Business** — Protecting customers, partners, and employees from irreversible or opaque AI outcomes, while enabling auditability for compliance.
- **Public Sector** — Maintaining citizen trust by providing clear intervention points and transparent logging in AI-assisted services.

## Benefits to Governance
- **Prevention over remediation** — Stops harmful outcomes before enforcement, reducing cost and risk.
- **Auditability** — Provides a jurisdiction-agnostic event record that can survive cross-border transfers.
- **Trust preservation** — Maintains the integrity of dependent trust conditions: Escalation, Exit, and Accountability.
