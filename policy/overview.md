# REET — The Structural Governance Standard for AI  
## Policy Overview  

---

## Purpose
REET is the Structural Governance Standard for AI. It is a structural safeguard that ensures individuals and organisations can halt, alter, or redirect AI-driven decisions before they cause harm or become binding. This must occur without penalty, without loss of access, and with an alternative pathway preserved.  

---

## Policy Relevance
REET directly supports policy objectives across domains:  

- **Education** — Safeguards students, educators, and institutions from automated decisions that may be inaccurate, biased, or harmful.  
- **Business** — Protects customers, partners, and employees from irreversible or opaque AI outcomes, while ensuring auditability for compliance and oversight.  
- **Public Sector** — Maintains citizen trust by providing clear intervention points, transparent logging, and durable evidence in AI-assisted services.

## Benefits to Governance
- **Prevention over remediation** — Harmful outcomes are stopped before they become binding, reducing cost and risk.  
- **Auditability** — Creates a jurisdiction-agnostic record of events that survives cross-border transfers and legal disputes.  
- **Trust preservation** — Maintains the dependent conditions of accountability: the rights of Refusal, Escalation, Exit, and Traceability.
