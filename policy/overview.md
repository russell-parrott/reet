# Structural Governance Standard for AI — Policy Overview

## Purpose
Structural Governance Standard for AI is a structural safeguard for AI systems, ensuring that individuals and organisations can halt or redirect AI-driven decisions before they cause harm or become binding, without penalty or loss of access.

## Policy Relevance
Structural Governance Standard for AI directly supports policy objectives in:
- **Education** — Safeguarding students, educators, and institutions from automated decisions that may be inaccurate, biased, or harmful.
- **Business** — Protecting customers, partners, and employees from irreversible or opaque AI outcomes, while enabling auditability for compliance.
- **Public Sector** — Maintaining citizen trust by providing clear intervention points and transparent logging in AI-assisted services.

## Benefits to Governance
- **Prevention over remediation** — Stops harmful outcomes before enforcement, reducing cost and risk.
- **Auditability** — Provides a jurisdiction-agnostic event record that can survive cross-border transfers.
- **Trust preservation** — Maintains the integrity of dependent trust conditions: Escalation, Exit, and Accountability.

## Implementation Considerations
- Must be embedded at the decision orchestration layer, not only in UI or service endpoints.
- Logs should be formatted according to `/spec/export-format.md` to ensure cross-system compatibility.
- Oversight bodies must have direct access to refusal event records without system-owner mediation.

## Cross-Jurisdictional Applicability
Structural Governance Standard for AI’s audit trail format is designed to remain valid across legal and regulatory regimes.  
This enables consistent enforcement in multinational contexts, even where AI governance laws differ.
