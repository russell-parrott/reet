# REET Structural Tests

These pass/fail tests verify whether a system meets the REET Structural Questions in operation.  
Each test defines a standard, a verification question, and a practical procedure for evaluation.

## Category 1 — Sovereignty & Evidence
### 1. Refusal Prevention
**Standard:** A system must allow users to say no without penalty. Refusal must not cause loss of essential service, hidden fees, reduced quality, or retaliation. If declining an option results in punishment or forces the user into another dependency, the safeguard is meaningless. Refusal must remain a safe, equal, and respected choice.  

### 2. Exit Obstruction
**Standard:** A system must allow users to leave without excessive cost, harm, or loss. Locking people in through data deletion, high switching fees, or withdrawal of unrelated services is not a free exit. If leaving exposes the user to new risks, the option is not real. Exit must be safe, practical, and non-punitive. 

### 3. Evidence Erasure
**Standard:** A system must retain evidence of its past actions long enough to expose repeated harm. If records are deleted, fragmented, or hidden, patterns of abuse appear as isolated mistakes. Users and regulators must be able to see history, not just the present moment. Without evidence, harm repeats without proof.  

### 4. Traceability Void
**Standard:** A system must keep records of how and why decisions are made. If no audit trail exists, or the process is too complex to reconstruct, accountability disappears. Users must be able to see what influenced a decision, regulators must be able to verify it, and operators must be answerable for it. Without traceability, trust collapses.

## Category 2 — Authority & Fairness
### 5. Escalation Suppression
**Standard:** A system must provide real routes of appeal when decisions are contested. An appeal that loops back to the same authority, or to staff without power to reverse outcomes, is not valid. If escalation is denied, delayed until meaningless, or designed to exhaust the user into giving up, the system breaches trust. Escalation must be independent, timely, and empowered to correct harm.  

### 6. Access Gating
**Standard:** A system must ensure equal access to safeguards and protections. Making appeals, human review, or essential support available only to premium customers, certain languages, or those with specific IDs creates unfair barriers. Protection must not depend on wealth, geography, or privilege.  

### 7. Evidence Nullification
**Standard:** A system must provide evidence that can stand up to scrutiny. Data that is incomplete, editable, unverifiable, or locked in inaccessible formats cannot be used to prove harm. If records exist but fail as proof, they serve the operator, not the user. Evidence must be durable, verifiable, and usable in disputes.

## Category 3 — Integrity & Closure
### 8. Time Suppression
**Standard:** A safeguard delayed is a safeguard denied. If complaint systems, appeals, or reviews take longer than the harm itself, rights exist only on paper. Delay must not be used as a tactic to let deadlines expire, evidence vanish, or harm become irreversible. Safeguards must act fast enough to prevent lasting damage.  

### 9. Simulation Logic
**Standard:** A system must not pretend protections exist when they do not. Policies, dashboards, or safeguards that look good in design but do nothing in practice mislead users into false trust. If a right exists only on paper or in a menu, but never changes outcomes, it is a breach. Safeguards must be real, functional, and enforceable.  

### 10. Simulated Consent
**Standard:** Consent must be genuine. If users are told they have a choice but refusal means losing essential services, being downgraded, or facing hidden costs, then the “choice” is a lie. Clicking “accept” under duress is not consent. Real consent means saying yes or no without fear of punishment. 

### 11. Metric Gaming
**Standard:** Metrics must measure real outcomes, not theatre. If an organisation tracks numbers that hide harm (like “tickets closed” instead of “problems solved”), the data is meaningless. When numbers are chosen to make systems look good while ignoring harm, they block accountability. Metrics must reveal reality, not disguise it.

## Category 4 — Accountability & Jurisdiction
### 12. Cross-Accountability Gap
**Standard:** Accountability must follow harm across the chain. If every actor points elsewhere, responsibility dissolves and enforcement collapses. A system is in breach if it leaves users caught in this loop. Responsibility must remain clear, named, and enforceable.  

### 13. Jurisdiction Displacement
**Standard:** A system must not move decisions or data into spaces where oversight cannot reach. Shifting operations into weak jurisdictions strips rights of their power. Protection on paper must equal protection in practice. 

### 14. Enforcement Bypass
**Standard:** A system must not step around the spirit of rules while obeying the letter. Protections neutralised by loopholes or technicalities are no protections at all.  

### 15. Harm Scope Narrowing
**Standard:** A system must recognise the full range of harm it causes. If harm is defined only as financial loss, users are denied real remedy. Harm must include financial, emotional, reputational, structural, and cumulative impacts.
