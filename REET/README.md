# REET - the Structural Governance Standard for AI

**REET** is the Structural Governance Standard for AI.  It defines how lawful control is proven and how accountability is exposed.  Through fifteen binary tests organised around four safeguards: refusal, escalation, exit and traceability, **REET** determines whether governance functions as a structural fact or a performative claim.

The purpose of **REET** is not to measure ethics, quality or sentiment. It is to produce evidence that regulators, buyers, boards, auditors, insurers and individuals can rely on.

Each test yields a direct result: the safeguard either holds or fails, revealing the exact point where authority breaks.  **REET** establishes the conditions under which trust in AI can be demonstrated, preserved, and enforced.

## Purpose

**REET** defines how governance is proven. It establishes whether an AI or automated system can be held to account through structure rather than statement. The standard converts ethical or legal intent into a verifiable condition: can a system be stopped, escalated, exited, and reconstructed when examined from outside its own design?

### Scope

**REET** applies to any environment in which automated decision-making affects people, property, or policy. It consists of fifteen binary tests—Q1 to Q15—organised around four safeguards: refusal, escalation, exit, and traceability. Each test has a clear question, evidence requirement, and pass/fail result. Together they determine whether accountability exists as a structural fact or as a declaration of trust.

### Significance

**REET** is not a framework, rating, or maturity model. It replaces interpretive scoring with direct exposure. A single failure identifies the precise point at which governance collapses; multiple failures show that governance is fiction. Regulators, boards, buyers, and individuals can rely on **REET** results as primary evidence of control or its absence.

### Outcome Definition

Passing **REET** confirms that governance is real, enforceable, and independently verifiable.

Failing **REET** confirms that governance is performative or absent in operation.
