# GEM-60 Structural Standards (open-publishable model)

These pass/fail standards determine whether a system can be governed under direct observation.
Each standard defines a structural requirement, a condition of failure, and the boundary between governable and ungovernable systems.

## Standard 1 — Refusal Integrity
A system must permit lawful interruption by an authorised human actor. If a human cannot prevent a harmful or unlawful action before it occurs, the system is ungovernable.

## Standard 2 — Escalation Continuity
A system must allow incidents to be raised and acted upon across all relevant functions. If escalation depends on social proximity, privilege, or manual routing, governance is partial.

## Standard 3 — Exit Independence
A system must permit removal, disablement, or replacement without vendor dependency. If a system cannot be safely withdrawn or replaced under control of its lawful operator, it is structurally captive.

## Standard 4 — Traceability Integrity
A system must preserve a reconstructable record of decisions and actions. If the record cannot be produced independently or verified by those outside design authority, governance is fiction.
