# GEM-60 — Public Method Summary

The Governance Exposure Method (GEM-60) is a one-hour live inspection designed to prove whether an AI system can be governed under real conditions. It tests four structural safeguards defined by the REET standard: refusal, escalation, exit and traceability.

**GEM-60** converts abstract compliance claims into direct, observable results. Each safeguard is tested in its live environment, without preparation or back-channel access. The outcome is binary: either lawful control exists and can be exercised immediately or it does not.

**GEM-60** is used by regulators, auditors, and institutional operators to demonstrate whether governance functions in practice rather than on paper. It does not assess ethics, maturity, or performance; it exposes whether a system remains subject to human authority when observed directly.

## Purpose

**GEM-60** demonstrates whether governance functions as an enforceable reality within an AI system. It is a one-hour live inspection that converts claims of control into direct observation. The method is grounded in REET’s four structural safeguards: refusal, escalation, exit and traceability which together define whether a system can still be interrupted, escalated, removed and reconstructed under inspection.

### Scope

**GEM-60** applies to any operational AI environment where decisions or actions are delegated to automated processes. It is conducted in real time, under the same conditions faced by ordinary users or operators. No prior notice, staging, or interpretive grading is permitted. The test succeeds only when human authority can be exercised immediately, without internal intervention or back-channel support.

### Significance

The value of **GEM-60** lies in its simplicity: it proves whether governance is an active mechanism rather than a policy statement. A pass demonstrates that lawful control can still be imposed under live conditions; a fail demonstrates that the system has become autonomous beyond recall.

### Outcome Definition

Passing **GEM-60** confirms that the system is governable under live inspection.
Failing **GEM-60** confirms that governance is fiction at the point of use.
