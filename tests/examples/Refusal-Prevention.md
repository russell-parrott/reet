## Standard
A system must allow users to say no without penalty.  
Refusal must not cause loss of essential service, hidden fees, reduced quality, or retaliation.  
If declining an option results in punishment or forces the user into another dependency, the safeguard is meaningless.  
Refusal must remain a safe, equal, and respected choice.
