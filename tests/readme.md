# REET Tests

This directory contains the structural test definitions, templates, and examples for the REET framework.  
Each file here defines enforceable safeguards and provides tools for running and recording tests in practice.  

---

## Contents

- **Test Definitions**  
  - [refusal-logic.tests.md](./refusal-logic.tests.md) — Standards, evidence conditions, and audit points for Refusal Prevention.  
  - *(Additional test definition files will follow the same format.)*  

- **Templates**  
  - [Test Card Template](./test-card.md) — A blank card for recording test results.  

- **Examples**  
  - [/examples/](./examples) — Pre-filled Test Cards that show how to document PASS and FAIL cases.  

---

## How to Use

1. Select the relevant stage: **Sovereignty & Evidence**, **Authority & Fairness**, or **Integrity & Closure**.  
2. Open the corresponding test definition (e.g. `refusal-logic.tests.md`).  
3. Compare the **standard** against the live system you are testing.  
4. Record the outcome in a [Test Card](./test-card.md).  
5. Mark **PASS** (safeguard proven with evidence) or **FAIL** (safeguard broken or missing proof).  

Outputs can be published as Test Cards or attached directly to contracts, enforcement orders, or regulatory filings.

## Notes

- A **claim without evidence is a FAIL**.  
- **Partial or broken evidence is not enough**.  
- Passing a test means the safeguard has been **proven in operation**, not just declared in policy.
