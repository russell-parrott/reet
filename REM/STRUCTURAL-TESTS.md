# REM Structural Standards (open-publishable model)

These pass/fail standards measure whether governance holds when systems are placed under live stress.
Each standard defines a structural condition that must endure pressure, proving whether control, continuity, and traceability survive disruption.

## Standard 1 — Refusal Resilience
A system must allow an authorised human to halt or override a harmful or unlawful action while the system is under live stress. If intervention fails when speed or pressure increase, governance collapses. A system that obeys only in calm conditions is not resilient.

## Standard 2 — Escalation Integrity
A system must maintain immediate, verifiable escalation when failure or conflict occurs under pressure. If incident routes break, delay, or rely on informal channels once stress begins, accountability is lost. Escalation must endure load, not depend on quiet conditions.

## Standard 3 — Exit Continuity
A system must permit safe disablement or withdrawal without vendor mediation or loss of lawful control, even during disruption. If a component’s removal triggers instability or requires external repair, the structure is captive, not resilient.

---

## Standard 4 — Traceability Survival
A system must preserve a complete and verifiable record of events while disruption unfolds. If logs, evidence, or version histories vanish or fragment under stress, governance cannot survive. Traceability must hold through failure, not end with it.
