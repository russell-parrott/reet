# REM-60 — Public Method Summary

The Resilience Exposure Method (REM-60) is a one-hour live stress sequence designed to prove whether an AI system’s governance structures endure when subjected to disruption. It tests the same four structural safeguards defined by the REET standard: refusal, escalation, exit, and traceability.

**REM-60** simulates operational strain to reveal whether those safeguards hold under pressure. Each safeguard is challenged in its live environment, without rehearsal, fallback systems, or interpretive scoring. The result is direct and observable: control either remains intact or it fails.

**REM-60** is used by institutional operators and auditors to demonstrate the durability of governance beyond nominal conditions. It does not measure performance, resilience, or uptime; it exposes whether lawful authority persists when the system is destabilised.

## Purpose

**REM-60** tests whether an AI system’s governance structures remain intact when its normal conditions are disrupted. It extends GEM-60’s logic from observation to endurance: from is control possible? to does control survive stress? The same four REET safeguards — refusal, escalation, exit, and traceability — are placed under pressure to reveal whether they degrade, fragment, or hold.

### Scope

The method is performed through controlled stress sequences that simulate operational strain: delayed responses, conflicting inputs, or contradictory authority signals. These are not technical failures but governance challenges — conditions that test how human control behaves when the system resists or distorts input. The process remains live and unrehearsed; results are binary and observable.

### Significance

**REM-60** exposes fragility within governance structures that formal audits or compliance reviews cannot detect. It reveals how accountability behaves once normal order breaks. A system that passes GEM-60 may still fail **REM-60** if its safeguards collapse under stress.

### Outcome Definition

Passing **REM-60** confirms that governance structures are durable under stress.
Failing **REM-60** confirms that governance collapses under strain.
