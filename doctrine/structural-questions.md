# Structural Questions

These questions define the minimum structural conditions required for a system to be considered trustworthy.  
They apply across jurisdictions and sectors and are intended for use in governance, oversight, and system design.

1. **Access Control** — Can authorised users gain timely access to the system without arbitrary restriction?  
2. **Decision Visibility** — Is it possible to see what decision is being made before it becomes binding?  
3. **Refusal Capability** — Can a user stop or redirect a decision before it is executed?  
4. **Penalty Protection** — Does refusal avoid penalties, service degradation, or hidden delays?  
5. **Escalation Path** — Is there a clear, accessible route for escalation to a human decision-maker?  
6. **Escalation Integrity** — Does escalation preserve the original context and evidence without alteration?  
7. **Exit Mechanism** — Can a user leave or disengage from the system without undue friction or loss of rights?  
8. **Exit Portability** — Is it possible to take relevant data or history with the user upon exit?  
9. **Breach Detection** — Does the system actively detect breaches of these conditions in real time?  
10. **Breach Logging** — Are breaches recorded in a tamper-resistant log accessible for oversight?  
11. **Audit Survivability** — Can audit evidence survive jurisdictional transfers or organisational changes?  
12. **Independent Verification** — Can the system’s trust conditions be verified by an independent party without vendor control?  
13. **Countermeasure Testing** — Are all safeguards tested live to prove they work as intended?  
14. **Safeguard Maintenance** — Is there a process to keep safeguards effective over time and through updates?  
15. **Transparency of Change** — Are changes to these conditions disclosed before they take effect?
